# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
This analysis was done to assist Pewlett-Hackard determine how many employees will be retiring in the near future. In addition to this,
determining the departments that will be inpacted the most. Lastly, to determine which employees are eligible for a mentorship program
to detmine if a proprosal is possible implement the mentorship program.

## Results
* According to our analysis, it was determined that there are a total of seven different job titles that will be affected by upcoming
  retirements. These seven titles are Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, Engineer, Staff, Technique Leader, Assistant Engineer, and Manager. 
* Of the seven job titles, Senior Engineer and Senior Staff titles will be affected the most with 29,414 employees and 28,254 employees 
  likely to retire in the near future, respectively.
* Upon doing the analysis for the mentorship program, it is determined that there are 1,549 employees that are eligible for the mentorship
  program. Of those 1,549 employees, there are 78 Assistant Engineers, 501 Engineers, 169 Senior Engineers, 569 Senior Staff, 155 Staff, and
  77 Technique Leaders. 
* Based upon this analysis, I would definitely recommend proposing the mentorship program. Because of the amount of employees that are close
  to retiring, Pewlett-Hackard will be needing qualified individuals to fill those roles. The mentorship program will certainly help train 
  employees to be ready to fill in the gaps when these positions arrise.
  
## Summary
* The total number of roles that will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact is 90,398. These 90,398 roles account
  for positions the seven titles Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, Engineer, Staff, Technique Leader, Assistant Engineer, and Manager.
* I do not believe there are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation just due to the amount of people each
  mentor would have to mentor. However, I would recommend still implementing the program because the company will need as many qualified 
  individuals as possible.
